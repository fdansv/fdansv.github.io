        <div class = 'description'>
            <p>- Mapbox</p>
            <p>For six months I led development of the foundations of Mapbox's Android SDK, which involved the construction of an all-new library to bring the company's maps to the Android community, in a completely open source project. I also had the opportunity of coordinating with exciting startups to integrate their maps, like Pinterest, Foursquare or Strava.</p>
            <p>- Drivescribe</p>
            <p>I spent some time coding up the navigation engine for the prototype of an app to improve drive safety. This included writing spatial Java libraries as well as implementing modern practices in the project like Git and testing frameworks.</p>
            <p>- Mapzen</p>
            <p>Prior to joining Carto, Mapzen hired me to work on Pelias, their geographical search engine and geocoder. My function was to optimize their use of Lucene and ElasticSearch to improve the relevance of the geocoder's results. In those months I had the chance to learn more about document retrieval and natural language processing.</p>

        <div class = 'description'>
          <p>I worked for almost a year in a small web development shop in London, where I had the chance to get a lot of experience in PHP, Django, and reinforcing my frontend Javascript skills. Towards the last months I was also involved in an Android collaboration with Coca-Cola for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

        <div class = 'description'>
          <p>I collaborated in a couple of projects of a London-based experience design studio. This was my first job as a developer and it mainly involved developing scripts to control sensors and screens in a sentient installation at La Gaite Lyrique, a museum in Paris, and making the MVP for a game which would later become Run an Empire.

          <p>I interned at an incredibly exciting department of the University College London's Facult of the Built Environment.
